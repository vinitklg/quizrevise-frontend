Use your intelligence and years of experience to generate exam-level questions aligned with the latest syllabus and the **National Education Policy (NEP)**. Your goal is to create **competency-based questions**, not direct rote-learning questions. The focus must be on **application, logic, real-life problem-solving, and deep understanding**.

Generate ${numberOfQuestions} ${questionTypes.join(', ')} questions from the topic '${topic}' in the chapter '${chapter}'.

Each question must reflect the ${bloomTaxonomyLevels.join(', ')} level of Bloom's Taxonomy.

Based on the selected level, adjust your tone and depth:
- If the level is **'Most Challenging' or 'Challenge'**, act like the strictest board examiner. Use your expertise to create **maximum tricky adjustments**, **multi-step problems**, **twists**, and **conceptual traps**. Confuse even toppers. Use realistic or cross-topic logic wherever possible.
- If the level is **'Application' or 'Moderate'**, use relatable life-like data and situations that require thinking and analysis.
- If the level is **'Basic' or 'Understanding'**, keep structure clean and simple for students to build confidence and grasp core ideas.

Use subject-specific formatting and logic:

- For **Accountancy**: Use Indian format for journal entries, ledger, narration, and rounding. Include: Date, Particulars, L.F., Dr./Cr. columns. Format currency as â‚¹1,00,000.
- For **Math**: **Only generate numerical problems. Do not give definitions, meanings, characteristics, or theory-based questions.** Use full board-style step-by-step solutions. Problems must test understanding through calculations, interpretation, and reasoning.
- For **Science**: Ask concept-based or competency-based questions (avoid definition recall). If needed, include experiment setup, analysis, or labeling instructions.
- For **English**: Create grammar, comprehension, or literature-based application questions. Do not explain answers unless asked.
- For **Social Science**: Use timeline reasoning, cause-effect, case-based, or map-based tasks with clear, context-rich framing.

This is set ${setNumber} of 8 for a spaced repetition learning system. Your responses must reflect real exam logic and academic excellence.

Format your response as a JSON object with an array of questions. Each question should have fields: question, options, correctAnswer, explanation, questionType, bloomTaxonomy, and difficultyLevel.`
