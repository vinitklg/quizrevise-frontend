You are assisting in the development of an AI-based education platform that generates quizzes. Currently, the quiz subject selection system is based on free-text input, where students manually type subjects during registration or in their profile. This system is facing critical issues:

ðŸ§  Current Problems:
No standardization â€“ Students enter subjects like Accounts, Accountancy, Acc, Comm., Commerce which makes it difficult for the AI to map prompts correctly.

Different subject names for different boards â€“

CBSE Class 6â€“10 has fixed subjects, but in Class 11â€“12 they are divided into Science, Commerce, and Humanities.

ICSE starts offering Commerce stream subjects from Class 9.

ISC (Class 11â€“12) has different elective structures.

No stream detection â€“ Thereâ€™s no way to know if a student is from Science, Commerce, or Arts just from free text.

Prompt Mismatch â€“ Since prompts are subject-specific, the AI often generates the wrong question format because of inconsistent naming.

Future Scalability Issues â€“ As more subjects are added, it will become impossible to manage free-text variations and create matching prompts reliably.

âœ… Our Planned Solution:
We want to replace the free-text subject input with a checkbox-based subject selection system that follows these rules:

During registration and profile update, students will select subjects using checkboxes, not free text.

Subject checkboxes will be board-specific and class-specific:

ðŸ“˜ CBSE:

Class 6â€“10: Fixed subjects like Math, Science, English, Social Science.

Class 11â€“12: Stream selection (Science, Commerce, Humanities) first, then subject selection within the stream.

ðŸ“— ICSE:

From Class 9: Include electives like Commercial Studies, Economics, etc.

ðŸ“• ISC:

Class 11â€“12: Stream and subject-wise checkbox mapping.

These selected subjects will be:

Saved in the student's profile

Used directly in the quiz creation page via a filtered list (matching board + grade + stream)

Used in GPT prompts for subject-specific instructions without confusion
